# Roofing-Siding-Damage-Assessment-Application
An app to streamline the process of identifying and reporting roofing and siding damage, ultimately helping homeowners, contractors, and insurance adjusters.

## Overview
The **Roofing and Siding Damage Assessment Application** is a user-friendly tool that leverages **Artificial Intelligence (AI)** and **Augmented Reality (AR)** to assist homeowners, contractors, and insurance adjusters evaluate damage caused by severe weather events. The application simplifies inspection by providing automated damage detection, classification, and cost estimation.

## Problem Statement
Severe weather conditions, such as hailstorms, hurricanes, and strong winds, frequently damage roofing and siding. Current assessment methods rely on manual inspections, which can be time-consuming, costly, and prone to human error. Additionally, existing solutions often lack accessibility, accuracy, and integration with modern technologies.

Key challenges include:
- Homeowners struggling to assess damage accurately, leading to delays in repairs.
- Contractors manually documenting damage, resulting in inefficiencies.
- Insurance adjusters require standardized and precise reports to process claims.

## Solution
This application provides a **smart, AI-driven** approach to damage assessment, streamlining the process through:
- **AI-powered image recognition** to identify and classify damage severity.
- **AR-based tools** for precise area measurements of affected regions.
- **Automated cost estimation** based on material type, damage extent, and local repair rates.
- **Standardized report generation** to assist insurance claims and contractor assessments.

## Features
- 📸 **Automated Damage Detection** – Upload images of roofing and siding for instant analysis.
- 🔍 **AI-Powered Severity Classification** – Distinguish between superficial and structural damage.
- 📏 **Augmented Reality (AR) Measurement** – Accurately measure damaged areas in real-time.
- 💰 **Cost Estimation** – Calculate repair costs based on local market rates.
- 📑 **Standardized Reports** – Generate professional assessment reports for contractors and insurers.
- ☁️ **Cloud Storage Integration** – Securely store assessments and retrieve them anytime.
